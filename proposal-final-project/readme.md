## Final Project Proposal


### *And so it begins...*

The time has come for the final project, slightly daunting but very excited to see how far I can push myself using the knowledge obtained during the class and research outside of the class material.

For my final project I want to create a musical night scene with objects(moon and stars) and the silhouette of a couple dancing animation. The stars would "twinkle" (move/rotate, within a fixed position up and down or increase then decrease in diameter) to the melody of "Dream a Little Dream of Me" by Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong, there will be a moon ellipse that will move across the canvas while moving to the melody of the music as well. While the moon and stars continue to move with the melody of the song, there will be an animation of a dancing couples silhouette. If I have the time I would also like to make the stars able to interact with the user maybe by allowing the user to click on them, drag and release them so they will move confined in the canvas parameters and if they come in contact with each other or the moon then they will change color.

My inspirations for this concept were the examples provided in this weeks material, including *"A Musical Scene"* by **Lindsey Sewell**,  *"Final Knight"* by **Ryan Stipe** and the sprite sheet of a large cat running animation. Along with my week 5 sketch I did that involved a moon moving across the night sky as stars rotated in the background.

I know that I will run into a bundle of problems, I will need to understand how to use music in my sketch, how to make my stars move in time with the beat, I will have to learn how to use a sprite sheet, then research on how to make my stars clickable so when you click on them you can release them and have them move perhaps using the `mouseReleased()` function.

In order to complete my sketch my internal deadlines are as follows:

- 11/20 *Finalize the idea for my sketch*
- 11/25 *Have some research done on how to accomplish my final concept*
- 11/29 *Have "vanilla code" for my objects I will be using done (stars)*
- 11/30 *Have images of the dancing couple to be used for my animation complete*
- 12/5 *Have the bulk of my code complete and avoid mental breakdown*
- 12/8 *Continue trouble shooting code and making sure the user can interact with the objects, avoid mental breakdown*
- 12/10 *Have final project complete and working, possibly cry*

Thus far in the progression of my final project I have the basic structure of the star object I will use done, I also have the preliminary sketches done for my simple couple dancing animation, I am still working on the final style of the animation. I am continuing experimenting with code and researching.
