## *Weekly Homework Report*

### **1. Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.**

This homework cycle I began to familiarize myself with the basic technologies that the creative coding class will be utilizing. Emphasizing text documents and text editors and how they would work together in a Git GUI Application. I made the following choices after reviewing the information provided this week:
- GitHub's Atom  - I used this editor because it was featured in the tutorial, although I may change due to having an older Windows computer.
- GitHub Desktop - I used this instead of SourceTree because I did not know if I would have to update my OS to avoid problems that had been mentioned.

### **2. What steps did you take to complete the assignment?**

In order to complete the assignment the steps I took are as follows:

1. Work my way through the provided information in the courses tabs
 -  *Overview*
 -  *Text Documents*
 -  *Text Editors*
 -  *Git Vesion Control*
 -  *Git GUI Applications (GitHub Desktop)*
 -  *Git GUI Applications (SourceTree)*
 -  *Working with Git*
 -  *GitHub.com*
 -  *Markup & Markdown*
 -  *Homework*
 -  *Video Setup Examples*
 -  *Weekly Conclusions*
2. Seek additional help from online resources for clarification on some language confusion
3. See if any fellow students came across some problems I was encountering on the class repo issue tracker
4. Re-read and rewatch material as much as I needed
5. Constant reassurance that I'm doing my best

### **3. Did you have any problems or issues? How did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class repo issue tracker? Did you recieve any useful feedback from your classmates?**

I ran into a few issues during this assignment but I was able to solve them by taking a break from the computer and trying to find a new perspective. Then again Google is a wonderful place to consult as a first line of defense and switching to another browser. A problem I did encounter occured when I was using Git Bash, instead of using `open` I had to use `explorer`. Looking at my fellow classmates questions and feedback helped me immensely though because I came across some issues they were having as well.

### **4. Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?**

Everything that was talked about this week I want to discuss further to get a better understanding of how I can use these as a foundation to build creative projects. It also made me curious about researching beginner coding projects and how I collaborate on them, [Coding Projects for Beginners](http://www.programmingforbeginnersbook.com/blog/what_should_i_make_beginner_programming_project_ideas/).

### **5. What issues did you help your fellow classmates with this past homework cycle?**

 Unfortunately I was not able to contribute to helping any of my fellow classmates with some of the issues, but as time progresses I hope that I am able to help with something.
